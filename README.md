# LanguageModel-Assistant
 Building an Intelligent Language Model Assistant with API Integration.
## About the Project

The Gorilla LLM Assistant is designed to make computers understand and use human language more effectively. By integrating with Gorilla LLM and Streamlit, it allows users to have meaningful conversations with language models and execute code generated by these models. It's like having an intelligent assistant that understands context and responds intelligently.

## Key Features

- **API Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with Gorilla LLM to access a range of powerful language models.
- **Streamlit UI**: A user-friendly interface built with Streamlit for an intuitive user experience.
- **Contextual Understanding**: The assistant comprehends user input and selects the most suitable API for context-aware responses.
- **Natural Language Interaction**: Engage in human-like conversations with the language model for intelligent and responsive interactions.
- **Code Execution**: Execute code generated by the language model and view the output.
- **Customizable**: Clone and modify this project to customize it according to your needs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the Gorilla LLM Assistant, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.x
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/): You can install it via pip with `pip install streamlit`.
- A valid Gorilla LLM API key. You can obtain one by signing up on the Gorilla LLM platform.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gorilla-llm-assistant.git
   cd gorilla-llm-assistant
Install the required Python dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set your Gorilla LLM API key by replacing "YOUR_API_KEY" in the code with your actual API key.

**Run the application:**

bash
Copy code
streamlit run main.py
Access the application in your web browser at http://localhost:8501.

**Usage**
Enter your conversation prompt in the provided text area.

Select a language model from the dropdown list (e.g., 'gorilla-7b-hf-v1' or 'gorilla-mpt-7b-hf-v0').

Click the "Start Conversation" button to interact with the language model.

The assistant will provide a response, and any generated code will be displayed in the "Generated Code Output" section.

You can execute the generated code by clicking the "Run Code" button.

The output of the code execution will be displayed, allowing you to see the results.

**Contributing:**
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to contribute to the Gorilla LLM Assistant project, please follow these steps:

Fork the repository on GitHub.

Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix:

bash
git checkout -b feature/new-feature
Make your changes and commit them:

bash
git commit -m "Add new feature"
Push your changes to your fork on GitHub:

bash
git push origin feature/new-feature
Open a pull request on the original repository.

Make sure to replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual Gorilla LLM API key, and customize any other sections of the README to fit your specific project details. You can also add screenshots or images to enhance the README's visual appeal.
